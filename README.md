# Programming Idioms
What is an idiom? (Dictionary.com)

1.
an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of its constituent elements, as kick the bucket or hang one's head, or from the general grammatical rules of a language, as the table round for the round table, and that is not a constituent of a larger expression of like characteristics.

2.
a language, dialect, or style of speaking peculiar to a people.

3.
a construction or expression of one language whose parts correspond to elements in another language but whose total structure or meaning is not matched in the same way in the second language.

4.
the peculiar character or genius of a language.

5.
a distinct style or character, in music, art, etc.:
the idiom of Bach.

Here we mean more #4, with a little bit of #2 and #3. 

Idioms differ by language -- this is true of programming languages as well.
Thus, geting a handle on common programming idioms for your language of choice is essential.

# French Idioms (Non-Programming):

C'est la goutte d'eau qui fait déborder le vase 	the straw that broke the camel's back
("it's the drop of water that made the vase overflow")

Pédaler dans la semoule 	to go round in circles / to get nowhere fast
("to pedal in the semolina")
